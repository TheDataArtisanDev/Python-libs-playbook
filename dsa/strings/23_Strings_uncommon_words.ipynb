    "#  Strings - Uncommon Words from Two Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two sentences `s1` and `s2`, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s1 = \"this apple is sweet\", s2 = \"this apple is sour\"\n",
    "Output: [\"sweet\",\"sour\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s1 = \"apple apple\", s2 = \"banana\"\n",
    "Output: [\"banana\"]\n",
    "```"

    "## üí° Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Understanding\n",
    "- **Uncommon word**: Appears exactly once across both sentences\n",
    "- Not just words that appear in one sentence but not the other\n",
    "- Must consider word frequency across both sentences combined\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Algorithm\n",
    "1. Combine words from both sentences\n",
    "2. Count frequency of each word\n",
    "3. Return words with frequency exactly 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Set Operations Don't Always Work\n",
    "- Set operations only consider presence/absence\n",
    "- Don't account for word frequencies within sentences\n",
    "- Counter approach is more reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Practice Tips\n",
    "1. Focus on frequency counting rather than set operations\n",
    "2. Collections.Counter is perfect for this type of problem\n",
    "3. Consider edge cases like empty sentences\n",
    "4. This pattern applies to many \"frequency-based\" problems"
