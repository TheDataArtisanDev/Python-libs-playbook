    "## 💡 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "- **Segment**: Contiguous sequence of non-space characters\n",
    "- Spaces are separators, not part of segments\n",
    "- Multiple consecutive spaces still act as separators\n",
    "\n",
    "### Four Approaches\n",
    "1. **Built-in split()**: Simplest and most Pythonic\n",
    "2. **Manual counting**: Track state (in segment vs not in segment)\n",
    "3. **State machine**: Explicit state transitions\n",
    "4. **Regular expressions**: Pattern matching approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Algorithm (Manual)\n",
    "1. Track whether currently inside a segment\n",
    "2. When entering a segment (non-space after space), increment count\n",
    "3. When exiting a segment (space after non-space), update state\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Practice Tips\n",
    "1. Built-in `split()` handles all edge cases automatically\n",
    "2. Manual approach helps understand the problem deeply\n",
    "3. State tracking is useful for many string parsing problems\n",
    "4. Consider how to handle leading/trailing spaces"
