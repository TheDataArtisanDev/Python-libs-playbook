    "#  Linked List Cycle\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).\n",

    "Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0\n",
    "Output: true\n",

    "## 💡 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm\n",
    "- **Slow pointer**: Moves 1 step at a time\n",
    "- **Fast pointer**: Moves 2 steps at a time\n",
    "- **If cycle exists**: Fast pointer will eventually catch slow pointer\n",
    "- **If no cycle**: Fast pointer will reach end (None)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Two Pointers Work\n",
    "- In a cycle, fast pointer gains 1 position on slow pointer each iteration\n",
    "- Eventually they must meet if cycle exists\n",
    "- Like a faster runner lapping a slower runner on a track\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Variations\n",
    "1. **Start both at head**: Need extra logic to handle same starting position\n",
    "2. **Start fast at head.next**: Simpler logic, what we used\n",
    "3. **Hash set**: Simple but uses O(n) space\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Practice Tips\n",
    "1. Floyd's algorithm is optimal for cycle detection\n",
    "2. Two pointers technique appears in many problems\n",
    "3. Always check for empty list or single node\n",
    "4. This pattern extends to finding cycle start position\n",
    "5. Draw diagrams to understand pointer movements"
