    "## 💡 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### DP State Definition\n",
    "- `dp[i][w]` = maximum value using first i items with capacity w\n",
    "- **Choice**: For each item, take it or leave it\n",
    "- **Constraint**: Each item can be taken at most once\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Recurrence\n",
    "```\n",
    "if weight[i-1] > w:\n",
    "    dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]  # Can't take item\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    dp[i][w] = max(\n",
    "        dp[i-1][w],                              # Don't take\n",
    "        dp[i-1][w - weight[i-1]] + value[i-1]   # Take\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Optimization\n",
    "- Only need previous row, so can use 1D array\n",
    "- **Important**: Process capacity in reverse order for 0/1 knapsack\n",
    "- Forward order would mean taking same item multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variations\n",
    "1. **0/1 Knapsack**: Each item once (this problem)\n",
    "2. **Unbounded Knapsack**: Unlimited quantity of each item\n",
    "3. **Bounded Knapsack**: Limited quantity of each item\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Practice Tips\n",
    "1. Classic optimization DP problem\n",
    "2. Understanding choice at each step is crucial\n",
    "3. Space optimization direction matters (reverse for 0/1)\n",
    "4. This pattern applies to many resource allocation problems\n",
    "5. Foundation for many other DP optimization problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Applications\n",
    "- **Resource allocation**: Budget optimization\n",
    "- **Portfolio selection**: Investment decisions\n",
    "- **Task scheduling**: Time and resource constraints\n",
    "- **Memory management**: Cache optimization"
