    "# DP - Min Cost Climbing Stairs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: cost = [10,15,20]\n",
    "Output: 15\n",
    "Explanation: You will start at index 1.\n",
    "- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.\n",
    "The total cost is 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: You will start at index 0.\n",
    "- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.\n",
    "- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.\n",
    "- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.\n",
    "- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.\n",
    "- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.\n",
    "- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.\n",
    "The total cost is 6.\n",

    "\n",
    "### DP State Definition\n",
    "- `dp[i]` = minimum cost to reach step i\n",
    "- **Recurrence**: `dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])`\n",
    "- **Base cases**: `dp[0] = cost[0]`, `dp[1] = cost[1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Difference from Regular Climbing Stairs\n",
    "- Each step has an associated cost\n",
    "- Need to minimize total cost, not count ways\n",
    "- Can start from step 0 OR step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Min of Last Two Steps?\n",
    "- To reach the top, you can come from step n-1 or n-2\n",
    "- Take minimum cost between these two options\n",
    "- This gives optimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Practice Tips\n",
    "1. Extension of basic climbing stairs with optimization\n",
    "2. Always consider what you're optimizing (cost vs count vs max)\n",
    "3. Starting conditions matter - can start from multiple positions\n",
    "4. Space optimization: only need last two values\n",
    "5. This pattern applies to many cost optimization problems"
