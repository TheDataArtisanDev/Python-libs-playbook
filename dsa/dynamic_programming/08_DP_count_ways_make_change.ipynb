    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money, return the number of combinations that make up that amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:\n",
    "5=5\n",
    "5=2+2+1\n",
    "5=2+1+1+1\n",
    "5=1+1+1+1+1\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "```"

    "## üí° Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combinations vs Permutations\n",
    "- **Combinations**: Order doesn't matter, [1,2] same as [2,1]\n",
    "- **Permutations**: Order matters, [1,2] different from [2,1]\n",
    "- This problem asks for combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "### DP State Definition\n",
    "- `dp[i][j]` = ways to make amount j using first i coins\n",
    "- **Recurrence**: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-coin]`\n",
    "- Two choices: use current coin or don't use it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Optimization Key Insight\n",
    "- Process coins in outer loop for combinations\n",
    "- Process amounts in outer loop for permutations\n",
    "- Order of loops determines if order matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Case\n",
    "- `dp[0] = 1` (one way to make amount 0: use no coins)\n",
    "- All other initial values are 0\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Practice Tips\n",
    "1. Different from \"minimum coins\" - now counting ways\n",
    "2. Loop order crucial: coins outer = combinations, amounts outer = permutations\n",
    "3. This is unbounded knapsack variation (can use same coin multiple times)\n",
    "4. Space optimization reduces 2D to 1D array\n",
    "5. Understanding combinations vs permutations helps with similar problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Extensions\n",
    "- **Change Making**: Find actual combinations\n",
    "- **Bounded Coins**: Each coin has limited quantity\n",
    "- **Maximum Ways**: Find combination with maximum number of coins"
